Rockit provides a framework to rapidly generate 3D models of workable model rockets.  It leverages [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/ OpenSCAD) to render rocket part specificiations to three dimensional models. This allows you the ability to configure and generate individual model rocket parts suitable for manufacturing on a wide range of 3D printing platforms.  With carefully configured paramaters, you can design, print and fly your rocket in under two hours.  Rockit parses JSON rocket configuration files and writes out to a variety of formats including .json, .scad, .stl, .dxg, .png.   It ships with a variety of default templates based on different engine sizes, but these will require local tuning for proper operation.
